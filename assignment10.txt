* learn loops and arrays:
1. from javascript.info: sections 2.13, 5.4 and 5.5.

* o the following assignments (push each assignment in separate Git repo):
1. write a small web app that does the following:
	- displays only the even numbers from 1 to 20.d
	- the result should look like this: 2, 4, 6, ...
	- hint: use string concatenation to accomplish the output format.
	
2. write a small web app that does the following:
	- keeps showing the user a confirm dialog box as long as the user clicks Ok.
	- when the user clicks Cancel it stops.
	
3. write a small web app that does the following:
	- defines an array of 20 number (positive, negative and zeros) and displayes their average.
	- you can define the array directly in the code and fill it with 20 numbers. (i.e. no need for user input)
	- the result should look like this: "The average is (average)".
	
4. write a small web app that does the following:
	- defines an array of 20 number (positive, negative and zeros) and displayes the largest number.
	- you can define the array directly in the code and fill it with 20 numbers. (i.e. no need for user input)
	- the result should look like this: "The largest number is (the number)".
	
5. write a small web app that does the following:
	- defines an array of numbers (positive, negative and zeros).
	- for each number in the array display the following: "(number) is even||odd"
	- example:
		* array = [1, 10, 3]
		* result should be:
			1 is odd
			10 is even
			3 is odd
			
6. write a small web app that:
	- asks the user to enter a number of any number of digits (strings and Cancel should be converted to 0).
	- display whether this number is narcissistic or not.
	
7. write a small web ap that:
	- defines an array of items (numbers, strings, etc.).
	- finds and prints the most frequent item in the array.
	- examples:
		* [4, "g", 4, "test", 5, 6, "g", 4]: most frequent item is 4.
		
8. write a small web ap that:
	- defines an array of items (numbers, strings, etc.).
	- remove the duplicate items from the array.
	
* when you are done with the above, finish the Arrays and Loops sections in Codecademy:
